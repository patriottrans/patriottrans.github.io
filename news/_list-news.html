<p>On January 30, 2020, Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (the "Company") paid a cash dividend of $3.15 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 4, 2020, the Board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share, payable on December 30, 2020 to the Company’s shareholders of record as of December 17, 2020.  The ex-dividend date for this dividend is December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Shareholders should consult with their individual tax advisors regarding these dividends. Patriot has sufficient accumulated earnings and profits for both dividends to qualify as a dividend for tax purposes rather than a return of capital. As Patriot is a U.S. corporation, Patriot management believes that both special dividends will qualify as a “qualified dividend” for shareholders who meet the requisite holding period.</p>
